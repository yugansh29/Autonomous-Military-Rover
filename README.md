### Software (Mission Planner)

Mission Planner is a ground control station software used for configuration and dynamic control of the rover's autonomous navigation and obstacle detection.

### Live Camera/Video Streaming and Storage

* Live camera feed for real-time situational awareness and mission control.
* Web-based interface for remote access to the live camera stream.
* Video recording stored on SD card for later retrieval.

### Mechanism of Motion

* Pixhawk autopilot module controls motors, sensors, and navigation algorithms.

### Hardware Components

* **2-channel ESCs:** Control speed and direction of the motors based on commands from Pixhawk.
* **12V DC Gear Motors:** Provide driving force.
* **NVIDIA Jetson Nano:** Central processing unit that runs autopilot software, obstacle detection algorithms, and sensor fusion software.
* **Pixhawk (Ardu-pilot):** Autopilot flight controller that translates commands from Jetson Nano into signals for the ESCs.
* **Camera Module:** Captures images and video for obstacle detection, navigation, and situational awareness.
* **LiDAR Sensor:** Creates a 3D point cloud of the surroundings for obstacle detection and path planning.

### Additional Sensors

* **MPU-6050:** Provides data on the rover's orientation for stability.
* **Obstacle Avoider Sensor:** Ultrasonic or infrared sensor for short-range obstacle detection.

### Motion Control and Sensor Fusion

* Pixhawk receives control commands from Jetson Nano (user input or autonomous navigation algorithms).
* Jetson Nano uses camera image data and LiDAR point cloud for obstacle detection and environment perception.
* Sensor fusion combines camera image and LiDAR data for a richer environment representation.
* Obstacle detection algorithms identify potential obstacles.
* Jetson Nano sends control commands to Pixhawk based on processed sensor data and obstacle detection.
* Pixhawk translates commands into signals for ESCs, controlling motor speed and direction for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.

### Societal Applications

* Search and rescue in hazardous areas (fires, collapsed buildings) by locating survivors and transmitting real-time data.
* Disaster response and civilian applications.

### Prototype Sizes

* Proof of concept (small version): 30 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm
* Actual version (prototype): 45 cm x 30 cm x 20 cm

### Development Timeline
